    \caption{Therapist Dashboard: Additional Features}
    \label{fig:rest-therapist-dashboard}
\end{figure}
The extended therapist dashboard is meticulously designed to streamline the workflow of mental health professionals. In addition to core client management tools, this view provides quick access to recent communications, notifications, and upcoming appointments. For instance, a therapist can review messages from parents, check the status of assigned missions, and prepare for the day's sessions—all from a single, unified interface. This centralization of information minimizes the cognitive load on therapists, allowing them to focus more on client care and less on administrative tasks.

The dashboard's layout is the result of iterative user testing and feedback from practicing therapists. Features such as color-coded alerts, customizable widgets, and integrated scheduling tools were added to address real-world pain points. By reducing context switching and making critical information readily available, the dashboard not only boosts productivity but also enhances the quality of care delivered to children and families. The design prioritizes clarity, efficiency, and adaptability, ensuring that therapists can manage complex caseloads with confidence.

\sectiontitle{Child Profile: Distress Signals and Monitoring}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Screenshots/restofchildprofilethatshowsthedistresssignals.png}
    \caption{Child Profile: Distress Signals and Monitoring}
    \label{fig:child-profile-distress}
\end{figure}
The child profile's distress signals feature is a proactive tool for safeguarding children's emotional well-being. By continuously analyzing self-reported data, behavioral patterns, and AI-driven insights, the app can detect early warning signs of distress. For example, if a child's mood ratings decline over several days or if unusual behavior is detected, the app generates a visible alert in the profile. This enables parents and therapists to intervene promptly, potentially preventing escalation and ensuring timely support.

This feature was developed in collaboration with child psychologists and educators to ensure both accuracy and sensitivity. The alerts are designed to be clear and actionable, avoiding unnecessary alarm while still prompting appropriate action. By integrating distress monitoring directly into the user interface, the SEE App empowers caregivers to take a more active role in their child's mental health journey, fostering a sense of security and trust within the family.

\sectiontitle{Mission Creation: In-Progress and Workflow}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Screenshots/middleofmissioncreation.png}
    \caption{Mission Creation: In-Progress}
    \label{fig:middle-mission-creation}
\end{figure}
The mission creation workflow is designed to be both flexible and intuitive, supporting therapists as they develop personalized interventions for each child. During the in-progress stage, therapists can define objectives, select activities, and adjust parameters based on the child's unique needs. For example, a therapist might create a mission focused on building emotional regulation skills, selecting exercises and check-ins tailored to the child's developmental level. The interface allows for real-time adjustments, enabling therapists to iterate and refine missions as new information becomes available.

This iterative approach is grounded in evidence-based practices, recognizing that effective interventions often require ongoing adaptation. The design emphasizes transparency and collaboration, allowing therapists to share mission drafts with parents for feedback before finalization. By supporting a dynamic, user-driven workflow, the SEE App ensures that interventions remain relevant, engaging, and effective throughout the therapeutic process.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Screenshots/restofmissioncreationtherapist.png}
    \caption{Mission Creation: Finalization and Review}
    \label{fig:rest-mission-creation-therapist}
\end{figure}
The finalization screen is a critical checkpoint in the mission creation process. Here, therapists can review all mission details, confirm objectives, and ensure that progress tracking is correctly configured. This step is designed to catch potential errors or oversights, such as missing activities or unclear instructions. For example, a therapist might notice that a mission lacks a clear success criterion and can make adjustments before assigning it to the child.

The review process is supported by built-in validation tools and checklists, which help maintain high standards of care. By formalizing this step, the SEE App promotes accountability and consistency across interventions. Both therapists and parents benefit from the added transparency, as they can be confident that each mission has been carefully vetted before implementation.

\sectiontitle{Therapist Directory and Assignment}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Screenshots/therapists.png}
    \caption{Therapist Directory}
    \label{fig:therapists-directory}

The therapist directory is a powerful tool for connecting families with qualified mental health professionals. Users can search, filter, and browse therapist profiles, reviewing credentials, areas of expertise, and availability. For example, a parent seeking a therapist with experience in autism spectrum disorders can quickly identify suitable candidates and initiate contact. The directory's design emphasizes transparency and informed choice, empowering families to make decisions that best meet their needs.

This feature also streamlines the assignment process for administrators, who can match children with therapists based on specific criteria. The directory is regularly updated to reflect changes in therapist availability and qualifications, ensuring that users always have access to accurate information. By facilitating efficient, informed connections, the SEE App helps ensure that every child receives the support they need from a trusted professional.

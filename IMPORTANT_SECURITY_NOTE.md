# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE

The current Firebase security rules include a very permissive rule:

```
// Allow any signed-in user full access for diagnostic testing
match /{document=**} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
}
```

This rule provides READ access to ALL collections for any authenticated user, which is useful for diagnostic purposes but presents security risks in production.

## Why This Exists

1. The broad permissions help diagnose Firebase connectivity issues
2. It ensures all collections can be read for testing purposes
3. It provides a fallback while you're setting up proper security rules

## How to Restrict It

Once your diagnostics pass and you've confirmed proper access to all collections, modify the security rules to:

1. Remove the wildcard rule entirely
2. Add specific rules for each collection you need
3. Implement proper role-based access control

## Next Steps

1. Run diagnostic tests to ensure everything is working
2. Create Firebase indexes for any compound queries that show errors
3. After confirming functionality, remove the broad permissions
4. Deploy more restrictive security rules for production use

Remember: **Authentication alone is not sufficient protection for sensitive data in production environments**. Each collection should have explicit rules based on user roles and ownership.

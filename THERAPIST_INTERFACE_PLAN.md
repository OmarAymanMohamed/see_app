### **Actionable Step-by-Step Plan to Finish the Interface**

This plan is structured to deliver the highest-value features first.

#### **Phase 1: Complete Core Client & Messaging Features (High Priority)**

*   **Step 1: Build the `Client Profile` Screen.**
    *   Create a new screen that displays all information for a selected client.
    *   This screen will have tabs for:
        *   **Overview:** Key stats, recent alerts, current goals.
        *   **Progress Charts:** Visual data on emotion trends and mission completion.
        *   **Session Notes:** A list of notes from past sessions and a form to add new ones.
*   **Step 2: Implement Real-Time `Messaging`.**
    *   Flesh out the `ConversationsScreen` to show a list of all conversations with parents/clients.
    *   Build out the `MessageScreen` to allow sending and receiving real-time messages, connecting it to Firestore.

#### **Phase 2: Add Value with Analytics & Appointments (Medium Priority)**

*   **Step 3: Implement the `Analytics Tab`.**
    *   Connect the existing chart widgets (`EmotionTrendChart`, etc.) to real data for the therapist's entire client base.
    *   Integrate the `GeminiService` to provide high-level summaries and insights (e.g., "3 of your clients have shown increased sadness this week").
*   **Step 4: Build out `Appointment Scheduling`.**
    *   Create a calendar view (weekly/monthly) for managing appointments.
    *   Add functionality to create, edit, and cancel appointments.

#### **Phase 3: Enhance with Custom Content (Low Priority)**

*   **Step 5: Finalize `Custom Mission` Workflow.**
    *   Add a feature to assign a custom-created mission to one or more clients.
    *   Create a "My Content" library where therapists can save and reuse their custom missions.

# SEE App Production Release Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions for preparing and deploying the SEE (Smart Emotional Enhancement) app to production environments.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed (version 3.0.0 or higher)
- Android Studio or XCode for platform-specific builds
- Firebase project access with production configuration
- Signing keys for both Android and iOS
- Developer accounts for respective app stores (if publishing)

## Environment Setup

### 1. Firebase Configuration

The app uses Firebase for authentication, database, and analytics.

1. **Create a Production Firebase Project:**
   - Create a separate Firebase project for production (i.e., "SEE-App-Production")
   - Configure Authentication (Email/Password)
   - Set up Firestore Database with proper security rules
   - Add your Android and iOS apps with the production package names

2. **Update Configuration Files:**
   - Replace `android/app/google-services.json` with the production version
   - For iOS, replace `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` with the production version

3. **Security Rules:**
   - Ensure Firestore security rules are properly configured for production
   - Test the rules thoroughly before deployment

### 2. Environment Variables

The app is configured to read certain values from environment variables for secure information:

- `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: Android keystore password
- `KEY_ALIAS`: Android key alias
- `KEY_PASSWORD`: Android key password

These can be set in your CI/CD pipeline or development environment.

## Android Release Preparation

### 1. Generate Release Signing Key

Run the provided script to generate a keystore:

```bash
cd android/keystore
./generate_keystore.bat  # For Windows
```

Follow the prompts to create your keystore file.

### 2. Configure App Details

1. **Update App Name and Bundle ID:**
   - The app ID is set to `com.seeapp.emotional` in `build.gradle.kts`
   - Update app name if necessary in `AndroidManifest.xml`

2. **Icons and Splash Screen:**
   - Ensure all icon assets are production-ready
   - Check splash screen implementation

### 3. Build Release APK/Bundle

```bash
# For APK:
flutter build apk --release

# For App Bundle (recommended for Play Store):
flutter build appbundle --release
```

The release builds will be signed using the keystore configured in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`.

## iOS Release Preparation

### 1. Configure Signing in XCode

1. Open the iOS project in XCode:
   ```bash
   open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
   ```

2. Configure signing and capabilities:
   - Select the Runner project in the navigator
   - Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
   - Select your team and provisioning profile

### 2. Update App Details

1. **Update Bundle ID and Display Name:**
   - Update in `Info.plist` and project settings
   - Ensure app version matches `pubspec.yaml`

2. **App Icons and Launch Screen:**
   - Verify all iOS app icons are production-ready
   - Check launch screen implementation

### 3. Build Release IPA

```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

For distribution, archive the app through XCode:
1. Set device target to "Any iOS Device"
2. Select Product > Archive
3. In the Archives window, select "Distribute App"

## Pre-Release Testing

Before final release, perform comprehensive testing:

1. **Install on Test Devices:**
   - Test the signed release build on physical devices
   - Verify all features work as expected

2. **Firebase Services:**
   - Confirm authentication works
   - Verify Firestore read/write operations

3. **Performance Testing:**
   - Check app startup time
   - Verify smooth navigation and interactions
   - Test on lower-end devices

4. **Data Usage and Battery:**
   - Monitor network usage
   - Check battery consumption during extended use

## App Store Deployment

### Google Play Store

1. Create or access your Google Play Console account
2. Create a new application or update existing
3. Upload your signed AAB or APK
4. Complete store listing information
5. Set up pricing and distribution
6. Submit for review

### Apple App Store

1. Access App Store Connect
2. Create a new app or update existing
3. Upload your build from XCode or Transporter
4. Complete the app information and screenshots
5. Configure pricing and availability
6. Submit for review

## Post-Release Monitoring

After release, monitor the application using:

1. **Firebase Analytics:**
   - User acquisition and retention
   - Feature usage patterns
   - Crash reporting

2. **App Store Metrics:**
   - Download statistics
   - User reviews and ratings

3. **Support Channels:**
   - Monitor user feedback through official channels
   - Address critical issues promptly

## Versioning Strategy

The app follows semantic versioning:

- **Major versions (1.x.0):** Significant feature additions or redesigns
- **Minor versions (x.1.x):** New features and enhancements
- **Patch versions (x.x.1):** Bug fixes and minor updates
- **Build number (+xx):** Incremented for each public release

Always update `pubspec.yaml` before creating a release build.

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:

1. Prepare previous stable version with updated build number
2. Fast-track submission to app stores as an update
3. Monitor the rollback for any additional issues
4. Communicate with users about the temporary downgrade

## Security Considerations

- Keep signing keys secure and limit access
- Regularly rotate Firebase service account keys
- Remove any debug code or backdoors
- Ensure no sensitive information is logged
- Implement proper user data handling
- Follow platform-specific security guidelines

## Fixing Gemini API and Firebase Issues

If you encounter issues with the Gemini API or Firebase permissions, follow these instructions:

### Gemini API Issues

1. **API Key Configuration**:
   - The app uses the Gemini API for AI-powered features
   - Two services use the Gemini API:
     - `GeminiService`: For generating insights about Down syndrome
     - `AITherapistService`: For the AI Therapist chat feature
   - Both should use the same API key for consistency

2. **API Model Versions**:
   - The app uses these Gemini models:
     - `gemini-1.5-flash`: For text-based generation
     - `gemini-1.5-flash-vision`: For image analysis
   - If these models are unavailable, update them in the services

3. **Testing API Connectivity**:
   - Use the System Diagnostics tool to test API connectivity
   - Navigate to login screen â†’ tap diagnostics icon
   - Test both Gemini API and AI Therapist API

4. **Troubleshooting Steps**:
   - Check if API keys are correct
   - Verify model names exist in Google AI Studio
   - Ensure API billing is enabled

### Firebase Permission Issues

Firebase permission denied errors are due to restrictive security rules. To fix:

1. Use the rules provided in the `firebase` directory
2. Follow instructions in `firebase/README.md` to deploy them
3. Test permissions using the System Diagnostics tool

## Running the App

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. Run the app:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

## System Diagnostics
